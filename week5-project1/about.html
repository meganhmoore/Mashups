  		<h1>About</h1>
      <h2>Concept</h2>
      <h3>This project focused on taking two different APIs and querying data from them to display it in a new way.
      I chose to use a lyric querying API, and a sentiment analysis API. In order to query the lyric
      generator I had to provide an artist and a song title to query from. In order to handle errors if both
      the artist and the song were not provided I had an error message, and I also had an error message if the
      API was unsuccessful in querying the data. Once the data was successfully queried from the lyric API I
      fed that data into the sentiment analysis API. The best API that I could find that was free and worked
      without backend support was from Mashape. This API allowed me to determine if the song had a sentiment that
      was overall negative, positive or neutral. By determining the sentiment, I then chose between a floral(happy) picture
      or a dripping rain(sad) picture as the background to display the data. The data that I chose to display
      consisted of the lyrics from the chosen artist and song, and the sentiment with its number.
      </h3>
  		<h2>APIs</h2>
      <h3>The initial data came from the apiary API's lyric reference, then I fed that data through the mashape
      sentiment analysis API to deduce the sentiment. The data I got from this API was a number between -1 and 1. If the number
      was greater than 0 it was a positive sentiment, if the number was less than 0 it was negative, and if the sentiment was
      equal to 0 it had a neutral sentiment.
      </h3>
      <h2>Difficulties</h2>
      <h3>
        <p>There were a few things that I had difficulties with, the first being the fact that many of the APIs that
        I wanted to use required backend support rather than having direct calls to their server every time. Because
        of this I spent a lot of time reading documentation of APIs, trying them out and then eventually not being
        able to get them to work. Eventually I used the mashape API which allowed me to access the data, with the
        addition of headers to authenticate my API access. The Lyric API was pretty straightforward once I found
        the right one.
        </p>
        <p>
          In accessing and displaying the data I ran into a few other problems. For one I had trouble formatting the lyrics
          correctly so that they were easily readable. I eventually found a line on stackoverflow that would replace
          carriage returns with linebreaks so that when added to the div, the lines would split in the right places
          The final problem that I had was making sure that the data was cleared everytime someone wanted to search for
          a new song and artist. I also found a line on stackoverflow that solved this problem.  
        </p>
